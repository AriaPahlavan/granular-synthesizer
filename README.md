# Granular Synthesizer

<br>

In high level, the purpose of a Granular Synthesizer is to sample a short period of 
sound, slice the sampled sound wave into smaller parts, continuously loop 
over those slices, and play them at different frequencies or times. 
Educationally, we learned how to interface a dual-channel DAC and an 
Electret Microphone Amplifier, how to store sampled sound in RAM, and how 
to perform dual-channel DAC output in the background. Our goal was to record 
and manipulate sound and play digital music. Furthermore, we learned the 
appropriate frequencies at which to sample sound using the Valvano postulate, 
to obtain a reproducible sample sound.
